[IBM Spectrum LSF](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0) (load sharing facility) is software to distribute work across heterogeneous resources.

Here is some general terminology used by LSF:

* Cluster -- a group of hosts running LSF
  * `lscluster`
* Hosts -- a computer in the cluster
  * `lshosts`
* Job -- a unit of work running on the LSF system
  * `bjobs`
* Job slot -- a bucket into which a single unit of work is assigned in the LSF system
  * `bslots`
* Queue -- a cluster-wide container for jobs
  * `bqueues`
* Resources -- objects in the system that can run work (including hosts, CPU slots, licenses)
  * `lsinfo`

## lsid

General information about how LSF is setup is the [`lsid`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-lsid) command. This shows the LSF version (10.1.0.9), the cluster name (lsf-cluster) and the master name (lsf-master).

```
➜ lsid

US Government Users Restricted Rights - Use, duplication or disclosure restricted by GSA ADP Schedule Contract with IBM Corp.

My cluster name is lsf-cluster
My master name is lsf-master
```

## lsinfo

The [`lsinfo`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-lsinfo) command lists the resources available in the cluster.

```
➜ lsinfo
RESOURCE_NAME   TYPE   ORDER  DESCRIPTION
...

TYPE_NAME
...

MODEL_NAME             CPU_FACTOR
...
```

## lshosts

The [`lshosts`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-lshosts) command lists the resources defined for each host. The `-o` option can be used to display more [information](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=lshosts-customize-host-resource-information-output). And the `-json` option can display the information in JSON format.

```
➜ lshosts
HOST_NAME      type    model  cpuf ncpus maxmem maxswp server RESOURCES 
lsf-host0    X86_64 INTEL_EM  60.0    64   256G   256G    Yes ()
lsf-host1    X86_64 INTEL_EM  60.0    32   256G   256G    Yes ()

➜ lshosts -o "HOST_NAME ncpus nprocs ncores nthreads"
HOST_NAME ncpus nprocs ncores nthreads
lsf-host0 64 2 32 2
lsf-host1 32 1 32 2
```

## lsload

The [`lsload`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-lsload) command displays load information for the hosts. The `status` field shows the load status of the host, the `r15s`, `r1m`, and `r15m` fields show the CPU load averaged over different time intervals, `ut` field shows the percentage of time the CPU is in use, `pg` is the paging rate, `ls` is the total number of login sessions, `it` is the idle time, `tmp` is the available temporary disk space, `swp` is the available swap space, and `mem` is the available RAM.

The `-l` option reports more information about each host. The `-o` option allows for setting the display information, similar to `lshosts` above.

The `lsmon` command is an updating display of load information, similar to if `watch lsload` were called.

```
➜ lsload
HOST_NAME   status  r15s  r1m r15m  ut    pg   ls   it  tmp  swp  mem
lsf-host0       ok   1.1  1.2  1.5  1%   0.0    0  102  33G 3.9G 624G
lsf-host1       ok   0.0  0.3  0.2  0%   0.0    0 8209  42G 3.9G 712G
```

## bsub

Jobs are submitted to LSF using the [`bsub`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-bsub) command. Some common options include:

* `-I` -- submit an interactive job
* `-Is` -- submit an interactive job with a pseudo-terminal (such as for `vi`)
* `-J <job_name>` -- assign a name to the job
* `-Jd <job_description>` -- assign a job description to the job
* `-P <project_name>` -- assign the job to the specified project
* `-eo <error_file>` -- overwrite the standard error output of the job to the specified file path
* `-m <host_name>` -- submit the job to be run on specific hosts
* `-oo <output_file>` -- overwrite the standard output of the job to the specified file path
* `-q <queue_name>` -- submit the job to one of the specified queues

```
➜ bsub date
Job <1234> is submitted to default queue <normal>.

➜ bsub -I date
Job <1235> is submitted to default queue <interactive>.
<<Waiting for dispatch ...>>
<<Starting on lsf-host0>>
Wed Feb  2 11:28:25 EST 2022
```

## bqueues

The [`bqueues`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-bqueues) command lists the available job queues.

A "-" means that the field does not apply to that queue. The `PRIO` field shows the priority of the queue -- the larger the number, the higher the priority. The `STATUS` field shows the status of the field (open or closed, and active or inactive). The `MAX` field shows the maximum number of job slots that can be used by jobs from the queue. `JL/U` shows the per-user job slot cap, and `JL/P` shows the per-processor job slot cap. `NJOBS` shows the total number of slots for jobs in the queue, summing up the pending, running, and suspended tasks. `PEND` shows the pending tasks, `RUN` shows the running tasks, and `SUSP` shows the suspended tasks.

The `-l` option shows much more information about each queue, and the `-o` option allows for changing the fields shown for each queue.

```
➜ bqueues
QUEUE_NAME     PRIO STATUS       MAX  JL/U JL/P NJOBS  PEND  RUN  SUSP
priority         49 Open::Active   -     -    -     0     0    0     0
normal           30 Open::Active   -     -    -     5     0    5     0
interactive      30 Open::Active   -     -    -     3     1    2     0
```

## bslots

The [`bslots`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-bslots) command displays information about available job slots.

The `-l` option displays information in long format, including information about how many slots each host contains.

Note that the number of jobs is not limited by the number of cores or threads available -- the operating system can easily switch between these jobs as needed.

```
➜ bslots
SLOTS RUNTIME
150   UNLIMITED

➜ bslots -l
SLOTS:    150
RUNTIME:  UNLIMITED
HOSTS:    100*lsf-host1 50*lsf-host2
```

## busers

The [`busers`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-busers) command lists information about one or more LSF user account.

Most of the fields are the same as the `bqueues` command, with `SSUSP` showing the number of tasks in system-suspended jobs, `USUSP` showing the number of tasks in user-suspended jobs, and `RSV` showing the number of tasks that reserve slots.

If `busers all` is called, it will show information for all users.

```
➜ busers
USER/GROUP JL/P MAX NJOBS PEND RUN SSUSP USUSP RSV
cody          -   -     3    0   3     0     0   0
```

## bjobs

The [`bjobs`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-bjobs) command shows information about all jobs submitted to LSF.

```
➜ bjobs
JOBID USER  STAT  QUEUE    FROM_HOST EXEC_HOST JOB_NAME  SUBMIT_TIME
1234  cody  RUN   normal   cody-mbp  lsf-host0 ./do      Feb 2 13:18
```

## bpeek

The [`bpeek`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-bpeek) command shows the `stdout` and `stderr` output of an unfinished job.

If the `-f` option is used, the output will be displayed with `tail -f`. Otherwise, `cat` is used to display the output.

```
➜ bpeek 1234
<< output from stdout >>
Wed Feb  2 13:18:41 EST 2022
Wed Feb  2 13:18:46 EST 2022
Wed Feb  2 13:18:51 EST 2022
```

## bkill

The [`bkill`](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-lsf/10.1.0?topic=reference-bkill) command will send a signal to kill, suspend, or resume unfinished jobs.

By default, `bkill` will send the `KILL` signal. The `STOP` signal can be used to suspend a job, and the `CONT` signal to resume it. Note that the `bstop` and `bresume` commands could also be used to suspend or resume a job.

Using `bkill` with a job ID of `0` will kill all jobs that match the other options (`-app`, `-g`, `-m`, `-q`, `-u`, and `-J`).

```
➜ bkill -s STOP 1234
Job <1234> is being stopped

➜ bjobs 1234
JOBID USER  STAT  QUEUE    FROM_HOST EXEC_HOST JOB_NAME  SUBMIT_TIME
1234  cody  USUSP normal   cody-mbp  lsf-host0 ./do      Feb 2 13:18

➜ bkill -s CONT 1234
Job <1234> is being resumed

➜ bjobs 1234
JOBID USER  STAT  QUEUE    FROM_HOST EXEC_HOST JOB_NAME  SUBMIT_TIME
1234  cody  RUN   normal   cody-mbp  lsf-host0 ./do      Feb 2 13:18

➜ bkill 1234
Job <1234> is being terminated
```

## Common commands

To get a high-level view of LSF performance, I typically run the following commands, normally in a `watch` command so that they continuously update.

```
# Get a list of all jobs being run
➜ bjobs -w -u all -noheader | sort -k 2,2
1234 cody RUN normal hostA lsf-host0 ./do
1235 cody RUN normal hostA lsf-host0 ./run
1236 cody RUN normal hostA lsf-host1 ./run -test
```

```
# See if the hosts are running and if they are accepting jobs
➜ bhosts
HOST_NAME      type    model  cpuf ncpus maxmem maxswp server RESOURCES 
lsf-host0    X86_64 INTEL_EM  60.0    64   256G   256G    Yes ()
lsf-host1    X86_64 INTEL_EM  60.0    32   256G   256G    Yes ()
```

```
# Check the status of the queues
➜ bqueues
QUEUE_NAME     PRIO STATUS       MAX  JL/U JL/P NJOBS  PEND  RUN  SUSP
priority         49 Open::Active   -     -    -     0     0    0     0
normal           30 Open::Active   -     -    -     5     0    5     0
interactive      30 Open::Active   -     -    -     3     1    2     0
```

```
# Look at which users are using LSF
➜ busers -w all
USER/GROUP JL/P MAX NJOBS PEND RUN SSUSP USUSP RSV
ashley        -   -     0    0   0     0     0   0
cody          -   -     3    0   3     0     0   0
```
