[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a fantastic site generator for blogging. In fact, this blog is powered by it.

To install it, follow the directions on the Jekyll website (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). The install was straight-forward -- simply make sure all the pre-reqs are installed (Ruby, RubyGems, GCC and Make), then use `gem` to install Jekyll and Bundles.
